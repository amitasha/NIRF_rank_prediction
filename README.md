# NIRF_rank_prediction
The main objective of this project is to rank the engineering colleges in India on the basis of some parameters. It also ensures that there is no
complacency in the colleges and they work harder each year to provide quality education to students.

Input:NIRF Parametres of 200 colleges

Output: Predicted NIRF Rank

I made my own dataset.This dataset contains 200 entries (200 rows and 31 columns) of different engineering colleges across India.

This histogram represents the important parameters which are required for nirf ranking. Because of this analysis
colleges will improve themselves to get better nirf rank.
